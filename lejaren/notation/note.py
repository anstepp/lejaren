"""
The Note object contains and represents notes with pitch and duration.
Pitches are represented in two domains: octave and pitch class. Each
is a separate data member, and can be modified separately. Duration
is one member.

Because the Measure and Part objects contain code to split notes across
measures, you can create a list of Notes objects and not split them for
the measure. This is useful for prototyping.

Users should only need to instantiate a Note object, or use the overloaded 
math operators. To create a note, simply create the object:

>>> middle_C_whole_note = Note(4,4,0)

The Note object overloads operators to allow for comparison of note objects.
There is an attempt to be intutitive. Equality tests for pitches, greater
than/less than test for pitch relationships, and greater than or equal/less
than or equal test for duration relationships. As follows:

note_1 = Note(4,4,0) # Whole note middle C
note_2 = Note(2,4,1) # Half note middle C#

>>> note_1 == note_2 # Middle C is not Middle C-sharp
False
>>> note_1 > note_2 # Middle C is lower than Middle C-sharp
False
>>> note_1 >= note_2 # A whole note is longer than a half note
True
